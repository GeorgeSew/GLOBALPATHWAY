            Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's

            Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, 
            chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named 
            Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, 
            northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy 
            Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815.
