            <br>
            Italy, a European country with a long Mediterranean coastline, has left a powerful mark on Western culture and cuisine. Its capital, 
            Rome, is home to the Vatican as well as landmark art and ancient ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance 
            masterpieces such as Michelangeloâ€™s "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; Venice, the city of canals; and Milan, Italyâ€™s fashion capital.
            <br>
            The land of pastas and pizzas and leather loafers and charming men, Italy is a brilliant holiday destination in the gem that is Europe. 
            Summer here is the peak touristy season, while spring is the shoulder season, with May attracting less tourists but showing the same 
            warm weather patterns. The temperature at this time is around 25Â°C and new flowers peep from every window. Light rains might be expected
            halfway through May but the latter half is dry and good.

            <br>
            <br>
            To plan your trip to Italy, start by deciding on the best time to visit, your budget, and how long you'll be 
            there. Then, choose your destinations (e.g., Rome, Florence, Venice, Cinque Terre) and create a rough itinerary,
            booking transportation and accommodation in advance, especially during peak season. Don't forget to research 
            attractions, book tickets ahead of time, and learn some basic Italian phrases.
